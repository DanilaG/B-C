# B&C
B&C (Bulls and Cows) is a logical game where you should guess the number.

## Run tests:

1. Generate mocks by [SwiftyMocky](https://github.com/MakeAWishFoundation/SwiftyMocky). In the project directory run:
```
./Pods/SwiftyMocky/bin/swiftymocky generate
```
2. Choose the `BAndCTests` target.
